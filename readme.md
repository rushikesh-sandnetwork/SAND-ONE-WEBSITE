# SAND ONE

<B>SAND ONE</B>  is the centralized version and, in the future, will be the key component of the company’s working.
The main 3 components which have been known are : 
- <B>COMMERCIALISATION</B>
    <BR>It is that component of SAND ONE which will be majorly used by the clients.
The component of creating dynamic forms by the admin and that form getting reflected in the UI of the application ( also included in SAND ONE ) used by the promoter or whatever the client wants to use it for.

- <B>DATA SAVING & USING</B>
<BR>SAND in its 7 years has worked on and completed many projects. Hence , it has lots of data stored but in scattered manner which needs to be structured properly.
The main idea behind this to make the company’s working faster given that some project in the past might have some component which can be used in the forth coming project. This will reduce the man power as well as the time of completing the project.
This is the component which will be internally used by the company.

- <B>HRMS</B>
<BR>This the component which handles the data of the employees starting from the days they have come to office and using this data generating their salaries.
Additionally, this data can receive data from the COMMERCIALISATION as well as DATA SAVING & USING component of SAND ONE.
Since , the dynamic creation of the forms can be used for our internal use and projects as well.
